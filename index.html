                        <h2>Ten Simple Things You Can Do to Help Protect the Earth</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Reduce, reuse, and recycle. Cut down on what you throw away. Follow the three "R's" to conserve natural resources and landfill space.</li>
                            <li>Volunteer. Volunteer for cleanups in your community. You can get involved in protecting your watershed, too.</li>
                            <li>Educate. When you further your own education, you can help others understand the importance and value of our natural resources.</li>
                            <li>Conserve water. The less water you use, the less runoff and wastewater that eventually end up in the ocean.</li>
                            <li>Choose sustainable. Learn how to make smart seafood choices at www.fishwatch.gov.</li>
                            <li>Shop wisely. Buy less plastic and bring a reusable shopping bag.</li>
                            <li>Use long-lasting light bulbs. Energy efficient light bulbs reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Also flip the light switch off when you leave the room!</li>
                            <li>Plant a tree. Trees provide food and oxygen. They help save energy, clean the air, and help combat climate change.</li>
                            <li>Bike more. Drive less.</li>
                            <li>Don't send chemicals into our waterways. Choose non-toxic chemicals in the home and office.</li>

                        <h2>Fun facts about cats</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>This interesting fact about cats is guaranteed to wow at your next dinner party. Did you know that originally it was thought that Egyptians domesticated the cat? But in 2004, French archaeologists discovered a 9,500 year old cat grave in Cyprus. This makes this the oldest known pet cat and it predates Egyptian art about cats by over 4,000 years!</li>
                            <li>If you thought cats spent a lot of their lives sleeping, you’d be right. According to Veterinary Hub, Cats actually spend 70% of their lives sleeping, which works out to around 13-16 hours a day. It’s a cat’s life!</li>
                            <li>An orange tabby cat called Stubbs was the mayor of Talkeetna, a small town in Alaska for 20 years! He had several uncontested elections and although he didn’t hold any legislative power, he was loved by locals and tourists alike.</li>
                            <li>Domestic cats are usually considered to be quite small and dainty creatures. But did you know the world’s longest cat was a Maine Coon called Stewie, and was measured at 48.5 inches? Whereas, the record for the tallest cat belonged to Arcturus at a whopping 19.05 inches tall! Those are some big cats.</li>
                            <li>The richest cat in the world according to Guinness World Records is Blackie. When his millionaire owner passed away he refused to recognise his family in his will and instead gave his 7-million-pound fortune to Blackie! We can’t believe that interesting cat fact!</li>
                            <li>Have you ever noticed that cats walk like camels and giraffes? Their walking sequence is both right feet first, followed by both left feet, so they move half of their body forward at once. Camels and giraffes are the only other animals to walk this way. Don’t believe us? Take a look at this video!</li>
                            <li>The scientist is most famous for calculated gravity, but it’s also believed that Isaac Newton invented the cat door. How Stuff Works writes that when Newton was working on his experiments at the University of Cambridge he was constantly interrupted by his cats scratching at the door. So he called the Cambridge carpenter to saw two holes in the door, one for the mother cat and one for her kittens! Apparently these holes can still be seen at the university today.</li>
                            <li>According to Ancient History Encyclopedia, Herodotus wrote in 440BC that when a pet cat died in Ancient Egyptian times the family members would shave off their eyebrows in mourning. Now that’s an interesting cat fact!</li>
                            <li>If you’ve watched your little kitty charging around the living room when they’re feeling lively you know that cats are pretty quick, but you won’t believe this cat fact. They can hit speeds of around 30mph which is so fast that they could beat Usain Bolt in a 200-metre dash!</li>
                            <li>The record for the loudest purr by a domestic cat is currently held by Merlin, a black and white cat from Torquay, UK. His purr is 67.8db(A) and for context, this is nearly the same volume as a shower! Most cats purr at around 25db.</li>
